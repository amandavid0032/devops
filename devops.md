## 📘 What is DevOps?

DevOps is an approach that improves collaboration between developers and operations teams to automate and streamline software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## 📘 What is Waterfall Model ?
In the context of DevOps, the Waterfall model is best understood as a **traditional software development methodology** The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential software development life cycle (SDLC) in which each phase must be completed fully before the next phase begins.

**Phases of the Waterfall Model**

1. Requirement Analysis
.Business and technical requirements are gathered and documented.
.Output: Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

2. System Design
.Architecture, database design, and system interfaces are defined.
.Output: Design documents

3. Implementation (Development)
.Code is written based on the design specifications.

4. Testing
.Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing are performed.
.Defects are fixed before moving forward.

5. Deployment
.The application is released to production.

6. Maintenance
.Bug fixes, enhancements, and support activities occur post-release.

**Limitations of waterfall model**
1. High Amounts of risk and uncertainty 
2. No Working software is produced until late during the life cycle 
3. One an application is in the testing stage it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well thought out in the concept stage 
4. Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects 
5. Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing

## 📘 What Is Agile Methodology?
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental software development approach that focuses on flexibility, customer collaboration, continuous feedback, and rapid delivery of working software.

Instead of delivering the entire product at the end, Agile delivers the software in small, usable increments called iterations or sprints.

**Key Characteristics of Agile**

1. Iterative Development
Work is divided into short cycles (typically 1–4 weeks), allowing frequent releases.

2. Customer Collaboration
Customers or stakeholders are involved continuously to provide feedback and clarify requirements.

3. Adaptive to Change
Requirements can change at any time, even late in development.

4. Early and Continuous Delivery
Working software is delivered frequently, reducing risk.

5. Cross-Functional Teams
Developers, testers, and operations work together closely.

**Agile vs Waterfall (Quick Comparison)**

| Aspect               | Agile      | Waterfall  |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Development style    | Iterative  | Sequential |
| Change handling      | Easy       | Difficult  |
| Customer involvement | Continuous | Limited    |
| Delivery             | Frequent   | End-only   |
| Risk                 | Low        | High       |
